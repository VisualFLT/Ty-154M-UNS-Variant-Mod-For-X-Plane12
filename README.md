# Ty-154M-UNS-Variant-Mod-For-X-Plane12
Fixed Tu-154M UNS variant based for xplane12 on the Felis Tu-154M (community continuation for X-Plane). some bugs are still being fixed. As far as I know, the autothrottle cannot be disengaged in some situations, idle thrust is too high, and the autopilot can't follow flight path during sharp turns. That said, you can at least load into the aircraft, start up this old beast, and complete a standard route flight.
