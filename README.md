# Ty-154M-UNS-Variant-Mod-For-X-Plane12
Fixed Tu-154M UNS variant based for xplane12 on the Felis Tu-154M (community continuation for X-Plane). some bugs are still being fixed. As far as I know, the autothrottle cannot be disengaged in some situations, idle thrust is too high, and the autopilot can't follow flight path during sharp turns. However, it's already usable for normal flight.
